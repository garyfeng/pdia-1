``pdia`` evolved from 2015 to 17 to process and analyze the process data (aka observables or action logs)
from the NAEP digitally-based assessments (DBAs). It provides functions to read the NAEP process data from a variety sources,
convert and parse them to Pandas data frames, and visualize and report on the data.
